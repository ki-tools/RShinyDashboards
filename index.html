# Introduction to R-Shiny and Dashboards

# :Dashboards:

## Opinionated views for decision making<br> that facilitate user input

![:scale 85%](img/car-dashboard.jpg)

???

Focus on all the elements that could go wrong with a car and how the designers make careful decisions about what sits in front of the drivers view.

Also, discuss how the dashboard metaphor is a bit complicated as the driver of the vehicle can hear and feel much more than what is before their eyes.  While a data dashboard only provides a visual sensation of the data.

Your charts, tables, and summaries are all that the user sees of data behind the scenes.

# Why use R Shiny?

### - Great for fast prototyping and fairly easy to use for someone who's not a programmer
### - Good for dashboards or very simple apps used internally at your organization
### - More customizable than many BI tools
### - Easy to make use of R's stats/modeling/visualization packages

---

# Why not use R Shiny?

### - For non-trivial apps the codebase can become very complex and hard to follow
### - Difficult to transition a shiny app to a support team, even if they know R/Shiny
### - Deployment requires a special server setup and hosting can be complicated or expensive
### - In most cases, not suitable for production environments
### - R is not a natural environment for specifying UI/UX
### - Performance: UI interactions requiring round trips to R that could easily be handled in the web browser

???

I've been handed many shiny apps over the course of my consulting work, and I've never had a situation where the app was easy to jump right into and reason about. The code becomes unwieldy very fast, even when following best practices.

If you have an app that you are going to spend enough time on to make it polished, and you want to make it widely available, in most cases it is more efficient to use industry standard user interface tools (JavaScript: React, Vue, etc.) and call R as necessary for calculations that must be done in R.

Most of the R/Shiny apps in production that I have seen feel sluggish and are often buggy.

You will find yourself pretty quickly wanting to do things with your UI that are very unnatural in Shiny and result in solutions that feel like hacks or begin to require knowledge of JavaScript. Things such as conditionally showing inputs, interactions between inputs (disable an input until another input has been selected), etc.

# What are some alternatives to R-Shiny?

![:scale 65%](img/comparison.png)

Focus on Dash, Streamlit, and Shiny.

Shiny is the only R language dashboard tool on this chart.

If anyone has a Python background, we highly recommend Streamlit.

# our potential inputs

  date >= date_range[1], date <= date_range[2]),

Before we get into Shiny code, let's write the code for our key chart in the display.

Highlight that we should 
1. think about the visuals, summaries, and tables we want to leverage and why we want to display them.
2. write the code in an R script so we see what we want in the chart and what variables we might vary.

# The Shiny app basics

Every Shiny app has two key elements: `ui` and `server`. When using `shinydashboard` our `ui` is a little different.

```R
header <- dashboardHeader(CODE FOR THE HEADER)
sidebar <- dashboardSidebar(CODE FOR THE INPUTS)
body <- dashboardBody(CODE FOR THE RESULTS)

ui <- dashboardPage(
  skin = 'purple',
  header,
  sidebar,
  body
)
```

```R
server <- function(input, output) {
    THE CODE THAT CREATE CHARTS, TABLES, AND TEXT FROM INPUTS
}
```

```R
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Our ['app_global.R'](app/app_global.R) code for the dashboard is in the `app` folder of our [repository](https://github.com/ki-tools/RShinyDashboards)


???

Focus on how shinydashboard leverages `dashboardPage()` and the respective sections of the dashboard `dashboardHeader()`, `dashboardSidebar()`, and `dashboardBody()` which is a bit different that the base functionality of shiny. 

Might have them download the `app_global.R` script.

# Using R-Studio for app development

__Building the interface:__ _Copy this code and paste it into `app_global.R`_

```R
# Setup ----
library(shiny); library(shinydashboard); library(readr); library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2); library(stringr); library(plotly); library(snakecase)
header <- dashboardHeader(title = "COVID-19 Global Data Dashboard", titleWidth = 400)
# Define UI ----
sidebar <- dashboardSidebar(width = 400,
  actionButton("load", label = "Import data from Our World in Data"),
  selectInput("variable", "What variable", "(data not loaded)",
    multiple = FALSE, selected = "(data not loaded)"),
  selectInput("location", "Which location?", "(data not loaded)",
    multiple = TRUE, selected = "(data not loaded)"),
  dateRangeInput("daterange", "Date range:",
    start = "2020-01-01", end = "2022-12-31"),
  actionButton("makeplot", label = "Explore Visualization")
)
body <- dashboardBody(
  box(title = "Pandemic time-series", solidHeader = TRUE, width = 16, collapsible = TRUE,
    plotlyOutput("timeseries", height = 500, width = "auto")),
  box(title = "Total reported cases (World)", solidHeader = TRUE, width = 6,
    div(style = "font-size:50px", textOutput("casetotal"))),
  box(title = "Total reported deaths (World)", solidHeader = TRUE, width = 6,
    div(style = "font-size:50px", textOutput("deathtotal")))
)

# Run the application ----
ui <- dashboardPage(skin = "purple", header, sidebar, body)
server <- function(input, output, session) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

???

This code has a lot happening that we don't have the time to discuss in detail.  You can see links to each of the functions used at `app/readme.md`.

The functions have pretty clear names that allow you to see its functionality by the name. 

Some of the functions are html wrappers.

---

class: left, middle
# Server: Add body elements (Data & Totals)

Include these [`reactiveVal()`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.3.0/reactiveVal.html) assignments before the `server` function.

```R
covid_data <- reactiveVal()
plot_data <- reactiveVal()
```

Now include our data import event within the `server <- function(input, output, session) { }`.

```R
# Data ingestion and total number calculations. Set to work after `input$load` occurs from clicking on Import Data.
observeEvent(input$load, {
  url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv"
  owid_data <- readr::read_csv(url)
  covid_data(owid_data) # This reactive item now has is composed of the COVID-19 data.
  # assigning them into the output object allows them to be called by the `ui`
  output$deathtotal <- renderText(owid_data %>% filter(location == "World", date == max(date)) %>%
      pull(total_deaths) %>% sum() %>% format(big.mark = ","))

  output$casetotal <- renderText(owid_data %>% filter(location == "World", date == max(date)) %>%
      pull(total_cases) %>% sum() %>% format(big.mark = ","))

  # update inputs to reflect options found in the data
  choices <- names(owid_data); names(choices) <- to_title_case(choices)
  updateSelectInput(session, "variable", choices = choices,
    selected = "total_cases_per_million")
  updateSelectInput(session, "location", choices = unique(owid_data$location),
    selected = "World")
})
```

???

Highlight the `input` and 'output' functionality. How we can assign `render__` functions as a list element and get values from our ui using the `input$` construct.

---

# Server: Add body elements (Chart).

```R
observeEvent(input$makeplot, {
  # notice use of `input$` to pull the user input values into the function.
  # "if" stops outputs from being created if user hasn't clicked import
  if (length(covid_data()) != 0) {
    newdat <- covid_data() %>%
      filter(location %in% input$location,
        date >= input$daterange[1],
        date <= input$daterange[2])
    # This reactive item now has is composed of the filtered data.
    plot_data(newdat)
    # notice the use of plot_data() as the data object to signal a reactive dataset.
    output$timeseries <- renderPlotly({
      ggplot(data = plot_data(),
        aes_string("date", isolate(input$variable), color = "location")) +
        geom_point(size = 0.8, alpha = 0.8) +
        geom_line() +
        theme_bw() +
        labs(
          title = paste0("Progression of the pandemic from ",
            input$daterange[1], " to ", input$daterange[2]),
          x = "Date",
          y = isolate(to_title_case(input$variable)),
          color = "Location") +
        guides(color = guide_legend(
          override.aes = list(lty = NA, size = 5, shape = 15)))
    })
  }
})
```

???

May want to highlight how our ggplot changes to handle the shiny paradigm.  The use of 

- `.data[['input$variable']]`
- `input#daterange[1]`
- `plotdata()`
- all wrapped in `renderPlot()`
