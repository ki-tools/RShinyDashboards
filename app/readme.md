A simple example of [`shiny`](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) and [`shinydashboards`](https://github.com/rstudio/shinydashboard) to build your first interactive dashboard.

## Our Goal

> Give our user the opportunity to see reported COVID-19 cases for selected states over a specified time window using the [New York Times COVID-19 data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-states.csv).

## Our Data

The New York times [updates this data almost daily](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/commits/master/us-states.csv). Here is the url to the latest `.csv` file - 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-states.csv.

## Our App

See [app.R](app.R) for the script. For some details on the script see [A Brief Introduction to R-Shiny and Dashboards](https://ki-tools.github.io/RShinyDashboards/). We recommend [shinyintro](https://debruine.github.io/shinyintro/index.html) to get a little more comfortable with Shiny.
